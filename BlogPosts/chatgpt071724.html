                    <h1>ChatGPT as a code-reviewing pseudo-tutor</h1>
                    <p>It's a scary time to be an aspiring computer scientist.
                    When I switched to CS, the first thing I was told was that
                    AI is going to replace junior developers, so have fun
                    flipping those burgers! But, after a few years
                    and discussions with some sane people, I believe that
                    ChatGPT can not be a junior developer.
                    And, even if a huge development is made and AI suddenly is
                    capable of doing everything a junior developer can, it is
                    still essential to learn and practice the hands on stuff.
                    Prompt engineering isn't always going to cut it.</p>
                    <p>I've been around AI almost as long as I've studied CS.
                    I've had the privellege (and I truly mean it) to be exposed
                    to generative AI as a tool in my coursework. It's becoming
                    an industry norm, and its essential to utilize it, else you
                    risk falling behind in a field that travels at
                    lightspeed.</p>
                    <p>However, I disagree with how my professor addressed it,
                    and how my classmates utilized it. I don't blame either
                    party, as permitting generative AI in coursework was a
                    highly experimental step, but I feel the need to address it.
                    ChatGPT does not write good code. It may pump something out
                    that functions, maybe even first try. But in terms of
                    readability? Forget about it.<p>
                    <p>While developing CamelCapital, generative AI was used to
                    write the main framework for our trading algorithm. I made
                    myself responsible for code cleanup. I had to rewrite nearly
                    all of the code that was generated, making it more idiomatic
                    and readable. It was helpful to have an outline for how it
                    functioned, and once I understood the convoluted stuff that
                    the AI-generated code was doing I was much more efficient
                    than I would have been starting from scratch. However, it
                    revealed one thing: ChatGPT is not that scary. Without my
                    code-review, that code would not have been clean enough to
                    submit, let alone be pushed to the codebase of an actual
                    product.</p>
                    <p>That brings me to the title of this article: a
                    code-reviewing pseudo-tutor.</p>
                    <div style="padding: 2%;">
                        <h3>"Code-reviewing"</h3>
                        <p>In my personal work, ChatGPT has been exceedingly useful
                        in helping me navigate confounding errors while using a
                        language I'm not completely comfortable with. A quick copy
                        and paste into a prompt and I'm getting answers that are
                        usually helpful. This resources has allowed me to
                        keep my nose out of cryptic documentation more than it needs
                        to be. It has undoubtedly increased my efficiency.</p>
                        <p>I do not feel as though I am competing with ChatGPT for
                        my future job. During these experiences I was able to work
                        with the language model.</p>
                        <h3>"Pseudo-tutor"</h3>
                        <p>This summer, I challenged myself to learn C++ on my own.
                        I had no prior academic experience wth the language, and I
                        was off-campus so I didn't have access to any personal
                        resources. In this situation, I used ChatGPT like I would've
                        used office hours.</p>
                        <p>Honestly, I have to say ChatGPT is an excellent tutor.
                        Forget browsing StackOverflow, the AI has already read all
                        of those articles and can summarize them for me, complete
                        with example code show casing the solution. This is really
                        where I started to appreciate ChatGPT as a force for good,
                        rather than something to be scared of.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Take everything I've mentioned with a grain of salt. I am
                    just a third year student with no professional experience. I
                    just have some strong opinions about AI and I'm sick of the
                    stigma around CS as a career in 2024. I haven't seen any
                    proof that AI will automate my job. I will continue to use
                    it as my unpaid tutor, and I will learn to use it like I
                    would any other tool.</p>
