                    <h1>PillPal Development Blog</h1>
                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>PillPal is an interactive study tool for pharmacy
                    students- specifically for my girlfriend, Pearl. I have
                    carefully designed it to include the features that she
                    wants/needs to review. She is a pharmacy intern at
                    Walgreens, so the design of the interface is directly
                    influenced by the IC+ system used at WG.</p>
                    <p>The tool uses real data sourced from the OpenFDA API.
                    Currently, the program only uses a small percentage of what
                    the API provides, information wise. This will allow the
                    program to expand as Pearl's needs grow more complex.</p>
                    <h2>Design Challenges</h2>
                    <p>When I dove into this project, my Python was rusty. I
                    hadn't written a Python program in over a year, but I wanted
                    to refresh myself since Python has become an industry standard.
                    So, the first challenge was Python syntax. I had just
                    completed a semester of OCaml, and written my first project
                    in C++ (TerminalSnake), so a dynamically typed language was
                    a tricky adjustment.</p>
                    <p>My second challenge was the tkinter GUI library. I have
                    experience with several GUI libraries (Java's Swing, OCaml's
                    Bogue), so the documentation was fairly easy to digest. Once
                    I got going, developing a GUI with OOP principles was a
                    welcome change. The OCaml GUI library I used in CamelCapital
                    (Bogue) left much to be desired.</p>
                    <h3>The List Table Widget</h3>
                    <p>My favorite part of the GUI for this program is the
                    custom ListTable widget I designed to facilitate displaying
                    a multi-columned tkinter listbox.</p>
                    <div class="image_left_text">
                        <img src="../icplus.png" alt="IC+ interface example"
                        width="400px">
                        <p>On the left is an example of the IC+ interface I was
                        attempting to replicate.
                    </div>
                    <div class="image_left_text">
                        <img src="../pillpalexample.png" alt="PillPal GUI,
                        comparison" width="400px">
                        <p>Hopefully it is obvious which part of this GUI is my
                        custom ListTable. I group a listbox into a Themed
                        tkinter frame for each column in the table, then I link
                        the scrollbars and selections. Putting it all behind an
                        abstraction barrier, I have a custom table I can use in
                        other parts of the application and even other
                        programs.</p>
