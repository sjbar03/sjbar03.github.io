                    <h1>Towers Of Hanoi Development Blog</h1>
                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>I originally was given the idea for this application
                    during a CS 2800-Discrete Structures lecture in the fall of
                    2023. Our professor suggested that a student in the class
                    program a Towers of Hanoi simulator that would showcase it's
                    recursive solution. At the time I thought this would be very
                    cool, but I was intimidated as it was only my second
                    semester in the CS program and I was swamped in coursework.
                    After putting it off for months, I decided to make the
                    application during my winter break.</p>
                    <p>Marking my first personal project, this one is special to
                    me. I felt so much pride when I finished it and had a real
                    application I could show off to anyone who was interested. I
                    am also excited to be sharing it here- on my blog.</p>

                    <h2>Design Challenges</h2>
                    <p>Taking this initiative and starting this project from
                    scratch was a big step for me. With minimal knowlege of
                    program structure and no experience with git, I embarked on
                    this jouney naked and afraid.</p>
                    <p>I quickly got the hang of things, and while I didn't
                    start using version control until much later- the files
                    survived long enough to make it onto my GitHub after the
                    fact.</p>
                    <h3>Concurrency</h3>
                    <p>During the original development of this sim, I ran into
                    race conditions frequently. My understanding of concurrency
                    was primitive, and my GUI was reading the gamestate before
                    the backend finished updating it. The program would still
                    run, but many bright red error messages would appear in the
                    terminal.</p>
                    <p>I came back to it much later and solved these issues.
                    Where it sits today, I am satisfied to call it complete.</p>
