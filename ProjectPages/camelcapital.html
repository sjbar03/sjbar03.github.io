                    <h1>CamelCapital Development Blog</h1>
                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>This project was built as the final project for CS
                    3110-Data Structures and Functional Programming. I created
                    it with a team of three other engineers:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Amaan Rehan</li>
                        <li>Carson Wolber</li>
                        <li>Jepthah Mensah</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I was responsible for building the GUI, as well as
                    refactoring most of the code to meet format standards
                    required by the class.</p>
                    <p>Our workflow during the development period for this
                    project was broken into three sprints, each of which lasted
                    about a week. Overall, this project was under development
                    for roughly three months and totaled 1800 lines of code in its
                    totality.</p>

                    </div>
                    <h2>Design Challenges</h2>
                    <p>My primary challenge during development was finding a
                    stable and well-enough-documented GUI library for OCaml.
                    Shout-out to the developers of <a
                                                           href="https://github.com/sanette/bogue"
                                                           target="_blank">Bogue</a>
                    for building a comprehensive engine with friendly
                    documentation.</p>
                    <p>Once I discovered Bogue, I spent hours combing over the
                    documentation and source code to learn how it functions.
                    During this process, I learned much about how to read API
                    documentation and how GUI libraries function in general.</p>
                    <h3>Custom Graph Widget</h3>
                    <p>To create the kind of GUI that I had pictured, I needed a
                    way to display and update graphs based on large amounts of
                    stock data. I ended up creating a widget that draws the
                    graph pixel by pixel. This was far from the most elegant
                    solution- but, with the amount of time I had and the
                    limitations of the library it was the best I could come up
                    with. And, it worked.</p>
                    <div class="image_left_text">
                        <img src="cc_graph1.png" alt="A screenshot of a Bogue
                                                      window with a simple
                                                      graph" height="300px">
                        <p>To the left is the first iteration of the custom
                        graph widget. I built this widget on the SDL Area that
                        is built into Bogue.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Generative A.I.</h3>
                    <p>Generative A.I. was used for part of this project (as
                    permitted by our syllabus) and it came with its own set of
                    challenges. The code produced was unorthodox, and while
                    it worked, the assignment required clean
                    and idiomatic code.</p>
                    <p>I was responsible for refactoring and documenting the
                    code generated by AI. In doing this, I combed over nearly
                    every line in the main algorithm and developed a good eye
                    for style. While I appreciate the benefits of Generative
                    A.I., the time I spent refactoring tells me it has a long
                    way left to go.</p>
