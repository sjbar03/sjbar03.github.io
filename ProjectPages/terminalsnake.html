                    <h1>TerminalSnake Development Blog</h1>
                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>TerminalSnake is my first venture into C++. I wanted to
                    build something fun, but also something that would challenge
                    me. I set out to create a clone of <a
                                                               href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)"
                                                               target="_blank">Snake</a>
                    without using a GUI library. So, I set out learning ASCII
                    escape codes and interfacing with the terminal.</p>
                    <p>Realistically, I spent way too much time on this little
                    project, but I don't regret it. C++ quickly became one of my
                    favorite languages, especially since I had just completed my
                    first ECE class and already had a comprehensive
                    understanding of pointers.</p>
                    <p>I will definitely be building more retro games
                    in the future, possibly factoring out my code from this
                    project into a terminal game engine.</p>

                    <h2>Design Challenges</h2>
                    <p>Achieving unbuffered input from the keyboard
                    without hanging the game loop was a new type of challenge
                    for me. I began using the <a
                                                      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses#:~:text=ncurses%20(new%20curses)%20is%20a,a%20computer%20terminal%2Dindependent%20manner."
                                                      target="_blank">ncurses</a>
                    library which provided the getch function, as well as
                    various options for manipulating colors in the terminal.
                    However, I discovered this libary was fidgety (at best) when
                    it came to cross-compatibility, so I resolved to use only
                    C++ standard libraries.</p>
                    <h3>Pre-Processing Conditionals</h3>
                    <p>Much to my chagrin, I discovered there was no universal
                    way to recieve unbuffered input from the terminal in C++, so
                    I was forced to learn more about pre-processing directives
                    and how C++ programs interact with the operating system. By
                    using conditionals, I was able to develop two seperate getch
                    functions for Unix and Windows.</p>
                    <p>Windows was easy, utilizing the conio.h library and its
                    _getch function. Unix was a different bear. After combing
                    through StackOverflow and interrogating ChatGPT, I developed
                    this function:</p>
                    <pre>
                    <code>
    char get_unbuffered_input()
    {
      char ch;
      termios old_term;

      // Get current terminal settings
      tcgetattr(STDIN_FILENO, &old_term);

      // Set terminal to unbuffered mode
      set_unbuffered_mode(old_term);

      // Read a single character
      read(STDIN_FILENO, &ch, 1);

      // Reset terminal to original mode
      reset_terminal_mode(old_term);

      return ch;
    }
                    </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>In hindsight, I could have just included ncurses OR
                    conio.h depending on the OS, but I learned a lot taking
                    these extra steps, so no regrets.</p>
                    <h3>Asynchronous Key Listener</h3>
                    <p>My custom getch function, as well as the built in conio.h
                    _getch functioned differently than the ncurses getch. There
                    was no option to make these functions non-blocking, so I
                    decided to run a listener loop in a seperate thread.</p>
                    <p>This listener object keeps a reference to the input queue
                    attribute of the main game. It loops continuously, checking
                    for input every few milliseconds. When it detects input, it
                    acquires the mutex on the queue, pushes the new input, then
                    releases the mutex. Because this loop is running in a
                    seperate thread, the main game loop will never be hung
                    longer than the amount of time it takes the listener to push
                    the new input.</p>
